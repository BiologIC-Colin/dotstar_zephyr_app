# Cool flashy led strings for the girls bedroom

*I'm an entrepreneur and a Dad; I have been using Zephyr a lot at work, 
and thought I would do something cool for the kids whilst learning!*

**This is an "Out of Tree" Zephyr application driving APA102 LED strips using an RP2040 based board**

Uses the Pimoroni Plasma board based on the Rpi Pico. I have a separate out of tree boards repository.
